# Personal Website V2 #
This is another attempt at developing my personal website. I hope that this time I will use better coding practices especially regarding OOP and the effects that it has on my HTML/CSS/SASS styling.

I chose to switch from React with Javascript and CSS to Next wiht Typescript and SASS in order to increase my understanding of more tools. I do not have a particular grasp on hte advantages of either, and I simply want to explore the technical development of other frameworks.

## Installing New Dependencies ##
I will install new dependencies with yarn as my package manager.

```
yarn install 
``` 
I will run development environments using yarn as well.
```
yarn dev
```
